# Roadmap plans

One markdown per roadmap item. Each file has the same shape:

- **Goal** — what shipping this means
- **Design** — approach, decisions, data model touches
- **Files to touch** — approximate surface
- **Acceptance** — how we know it's done
- **Effort** — rough time budget (see legend)

The headline [ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md) stays as the short bullet list; these files are the "open this before you start" expansions.

## Effort legend

| Size | Budget | Reality |
|------|--------|---------|
| XS   | < 1 h  | Trivial edit, single file |
| S    | 1–3 h  | Focused change, maybe 1 test |
| M    | 0.5–1 day | Cross-file, needs a quick design call with yourself |
| L    | 1–3 days | New surface, migration, or UX polish loop |
| XL   | 1+ weeks | Architectural — break down further before starting |

Estimates assume one focused engineer already familiar with the codebase. Double for context-switching / review loops.

## Index

### Production / ops — deferred

Tracked separately under [production/](production/) so the two streams can be scheduled independently. See [production/README.md](production/README.md) for the full ordering.

| # | Item | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| P1 | [production/first-boot-admin-password.md](production/first-boot-admin-password.md) | **Shipped** |
| P2 | [production/automatic-deployment.md](production/automatic-deployment.md) | Planned |
| P3 | [production/digitalocean-domain-wiring.md](production/digitalocean-domain-wiring.md) | Planned |

### New issue backlog (2026-04-20)

Sprint 1 shipped: N3 (admin language selector drives building area), N4 (admin URL prefix + translations), N5 (hero subtitle / CTA / portrait-label), N8 (overlay parity — closed, not a bug), N9 (timeline polish), N10 + N12 (Services + Testimonials base styles extracted), N11 (space-key bug — dnd-kit KeyboardSensor was grabbing space from inputs inside sortable sections). See `git log` 2026-04-20.

| # | Item | Size | Notes |
|---|------|------|-------|
| N1 | [logo-theme-integration.md](logo-theme-integration.md) | M | Logo poorly integrated in every theme, especially single-page layout |
| N2 | [admin-right-menu-overlap.md](admin-right-menu-overlap.md) | M | Right-side admin rail overlays content; blocks edits |
| N6 | [image-selector-unification.md](image-selector-unification.md) | M | Unified image picker across every module |
| N7 | [module-style-section-reload.md](module-style-section-reload.md) | M | **Partial** — base SCSS fallbacks shipped. Style-section respect + preview live-reload still queued |

| N15 | [folder-structure-reorg.md](folder-structure-reorg.md) | XL | Maintenance-oriented reorg; awaits user guidelines before starting |

| N17 | [design-v5-bundle-rework.md](design-v5-bundle-rework.md) | M | **Draft scaffold shipped** — v1 clone with ID remap landed; content rework + v5-specific enhancements pending |
| N18 | [public-site-mobile-topbar.md](public-site-mobile-topbar.md) | M | Adopt v5's mobile topbar treatment (logo + nav + language) into the live site |

### Debt

| # | Item | Size | Notes |
|---|------|------|-------|
| 11 | [debt-gqty-regenerate.md](debt-gqty-regenerate.md) | S–M | **Shipped** — regenerated cleanly, every hand-patched field now emitted by introspection |
| 12 | [debt-sanitize-key-v2.md](debt-sanitize-key-v2.md) | M | **Shipped** — v1 dropped, correct regex + collision suffix for long inputs |
| 13 | [debt-ghost-navigation-cleanup.md](debt-ghost-navigation-cleanup.md) | XS | **Closed** — root cause fixed; boot-time warning + script available for legacy databases |
| 14 | [debt-drop-react-drag-reorder.md](debt-drop-react-drag-reorder.md) | XS | **Shipped** — dep removed |

## Total rough budget

- Queued (non-held): ~16–24 engineering days after the 5 new items were added
- Debt: ~1–2 days
- Grand total: ~4–5 focused weeks for everything on this list

### Specific deferrals from the partials above

These four sub-items are repeatedly mentioned as "still pending" inside the partial-shipped roadmap files; tracking them centrally so they don't get lost in the per-item docs.

| Sub-item | Parent roadmap item | Sketch budget |
|---|---|---|
| LoginBtn render test + per-section-type snapshots + API integration tests | [tests-remaining.md](tests-remaining.md) | ~10 h |

### Dependency cleanup (`npm install` is now `--legacy-peer-deps`-free)

Dropped unused packages whose pinned peer ranges blocked clean installs: `@react-buddy/ide-toolbox-next`, `react-glidejs`, `react-scripts`, `@svgr/webpack`, `cra-template-typescript`, `uppload-react`, `draftjs-to-html`, `html-to-draftjs`, `@types/draftjs-to-html`, `@types/html-to-draftjs`. Migrated [src/Server/index.ts](../src/Server/index.ts) off the deprecated `express-graphql` to `graphql-http` (already a dep) so we can ship `graphql@16`; dropped `express-graphql` + `graphql-tools` + `graphql-playground-middleware-express`. Pinned `micro` to `^9.4.1` to satisfy `apollo-server-micro@3`'s peer (we never imported `micro` directly). All within-caret deps refreshed via `npm update`.

### Suggested ordering — non-production only
